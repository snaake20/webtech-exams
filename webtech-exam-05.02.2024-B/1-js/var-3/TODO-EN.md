# Implement two object types: `Person` and `Student` where:
- `Student` inherits `Person`;
- `Person` has two properties, `firstName` and `lastName` and a method called `walk` with no parameters, which returns a string;
- Apart from what it inherits, `Student` has a property called `faculty` and a method called `study` with no parameters, which returns a string.

- `Student` inherits `Person`; (0.5 pts)
- The `study` method can be correctly called on a `Student`; (0.5 pts)
